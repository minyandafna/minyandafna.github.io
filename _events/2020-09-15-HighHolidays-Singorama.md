Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s High Holiday celebrations.

Everyone has their own ceremonies and traditions associated with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; it is those ceremonies and traditions that make this time of year special. For us, one of those traditions is sharing the melodies and songs from the High Holiday services.
This year, we sadly won't be singing together at services due to public health recommendations. So, we're finding another way to share in beloved melodies.
Come, join friends and share your favorite High Holiday tune, melody, song, or nusach with us. Let's share our traditions with one another and fill this time with song!

A Sefard and an Ashkenaz online version of the Machzor can be found [Sefaria Machzor.](https://blog.sefaria.org/blog/2018/08/29/your-online-machzor)

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
