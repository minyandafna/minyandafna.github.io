Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s Rosh Hashanah celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian Maariv, led by community members, on both nights of Rosh Hashanah. 
On the second night of Rosh Hashanah, services will be followed by a festive potluck dinner.

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
