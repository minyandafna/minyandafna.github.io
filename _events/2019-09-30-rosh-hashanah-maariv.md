Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s Rosh Hashanah celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian Maariv, led by community members, on both nights of Rosh Hashanah. 
On the second night of Rosh Hashanah, services will be followed by a festive potluck dinner.
