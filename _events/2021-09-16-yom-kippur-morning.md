Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s Yom Kippur celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian davening led by community members. Davening will take place near Monterey Market; the exact address will be shared with attendees.

In order to participate in services, you must preregister through the above form by August 27. Space is limited but we will try to accommodate as many registrations as possible.

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year.
If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.

**Please note: completing the form does not guarantee your space.
You will receive an email confirming your space the week before Rosh Hashanah.
Additionally, services may be cancelled in the event of poor weather or air quality.**

Please let us know if you have any questions by emailing [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)
We look forward to seeing you there!

_There is a flight of 12 stairs and uneven ground at the davening location._
