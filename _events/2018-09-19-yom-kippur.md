Minyan Dafna will be holding spirited and songful Yamim Noraim (High Holidays) services in Berkeley for its fourth year. Join us for spirited traditional-egalitarian davening, led by community members.

We will be meeting in the Upstairs Meeting Room at Finnish Hall located at 1970 Chestnut St.

Services are free, but a donation of $18 per day or $36 for both Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur will help us defray the costs of space rental.

If you would like to participate in the services, read Torah, or volunteer in any other way, please email highholidays@minyandafna.org.
