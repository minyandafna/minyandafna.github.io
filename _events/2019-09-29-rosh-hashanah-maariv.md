Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafna’s Rosh Hashanah celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian Maariv, led by community members, on both nights of Rosh Hashanah. 
On the first night of Rosh Hashanah, services will be followed by a holiday dinner sponsored by Minyan Dafna.
