Come dance and sing with the Torah in celebration of Simchat Torah! We'll have Maariv and 7 hakafot, with Torah reading at the end of the evening.

No amplified music or instruments -- so bring your singing voices and songs.

This event is organized by local community members (in collaboration with Minyan Dafna & Koleinu) -- anyone and everyone is welcome!

We'll have kosher snacks and drinks available. We encourage you to bring your own drinks to supplement and share.
Youâ€™re also welcome to bring your plush Torah (if you have one).
