Celebrate Sukkot at our One-Stop Sukkah Hop! Stop by to say hi and spend some time in the sukkah or hang out for a while and lounge in the beautiful Berkeley weather.

The donations we receive around the holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
