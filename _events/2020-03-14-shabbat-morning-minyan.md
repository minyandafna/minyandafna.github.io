Dearest Community,
As many of you are aware, the situation around COVID-19 is developing rapidly and stricter guidelines are being put into place to help slow the spread of the virus.

Following the recommendations of public health experts, Minyan Dafna has made the difficult decision to cancel Shabbat Morning Davening this week (March 14) and Friday Night Davening & Potluck Dinner next week (March 20).

While it saddens us to cancel services and miss these opportunities to celebrate together, we feel that these cancellations are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of our community.

We encourage community members to continue to follow the CDC’s guidelines for preventing the spread of the virus such as frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact.

We hope that our wonderful community will have the honor of joining together again very soon. In the meantime, if we can provide support to you during this difficult time, please don’t hesitate to reach out by emailing info@minyandafna.org.

Wishing everyone good health,
The Minyan Dafna Team
