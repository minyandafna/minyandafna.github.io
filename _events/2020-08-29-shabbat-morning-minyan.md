Thank you for your interest in our outdoor service! We are excited to resume in-person davening and want to make sure we do so as safely as possible. Tefillah will take place near the North Berkeley BART Station (exact address will be emailed to registrants).

You must preregister at the above form in order to participate. Registration is first come, first served. Exceptions will be made for the following groups, who will be given priority: those saying kaddish or birkat hagomel and those who have recently moved to the East Bay (during 2020).

Before registering to join us, please familiarize yourself with the protocol for in-person davening, available above.

**Please note: completing the form does not guarantee your space. You will receive an email confirming your space by the Wednesday before the service. If there is no space, you will be notified and be given priority at future in-person davening opportunities. Additionally, services may be cancelled in the event of poor weather or air quality. If this is the case, participants will be notified by email no later than Friday before the service.**

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)

_There are narrow pathways and uneven ground at the davening location._
