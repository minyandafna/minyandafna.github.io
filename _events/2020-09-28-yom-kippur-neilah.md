Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s High Holiday celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian Neilah, led by community members. Davening will take place near the North Berkeley BART station; the exact address will be shared with attendees.

In order to participate in services, you must preregister through the above form by Sunday, September 13. Space is limited but we will try to accommodate as many registrations as possible.

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.

Before registering to join us, please familiarize yourself with the protocol for in-person davening, available above.

**Please note: completing the form does not guarantee your space. You will receive an email confirming your space by Tuesday, September 15. Additionally, services may be cancelled in the event of poor weather or air quality. If this is the case, participants will be notified via email by Sunday, September 27.**

Please let us know if you have any questions by emailing [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)
We look forward to seeing you there!

_There are narrow pathways and uneven ground at the davening location._
