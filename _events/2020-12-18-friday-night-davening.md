Thank you for your interest in our outdoor services! Tefillah will take place near in northern Berkeley (exact address will be emailed to registrants).

You must preregister at the above form in order to participate. Registration is first come, first served. Exceptions will be made for the following groups, who will be given priority: those saying kaddish or birkat hagomel and those who have recently moved to the East Bay (during 2020).

Before registering to join us, please familiarize yourself with the protocol for in-person davening, available above.

**Please note: completing this form does not guarantee your space. You will receive an email confirming your space before the service. 
If there is no space, you will be notified and be given priority at future in-person davening opportunities.
Additionally, by registering for our services you are committing to participating in our minyan and notifying the Minyan Dafna team in the event that you will not be able to join us.
Services may be cancelled in the event of poor weather or air quality. If this is the case, participants will be notified by email.**

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)

_There are narrow pathways and uneven ground at the davening location._
