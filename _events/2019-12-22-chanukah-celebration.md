Chanukah oh Chanukah, come light the menorah

We're having a party--there may even be a hora

Gather round the table, we'll give you a treat

Activities for kids and adults, and some snacks to eat

And for the lighting, bring your menorah and candles which burn bright

One for the first night, all together weâ€™ll light to remind of us of days long ago!

Join the Minyan Dafna community for a festive Chanukah celebration filled with friends, snacks, activities, and a communal candle lighting!


Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)

Looking forward to seeing you there! 


_There is a short flight of stairs up to the entrance of this home._
