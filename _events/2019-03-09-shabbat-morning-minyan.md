Please join us for our traditional egalitarian Shabbat morning service. We will be meeting in the Art Room upstairs in the Netivot Shalom building.

Davening will be followed by kiddush. Looking forward to seeing you there. Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)
