Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafna’s Rosh Hashanah celebrations.

Join us for Tashlich and to hang out in the beautiful Berkeley weather. Stop by to say hi or bring a blanket and stay for a while! We'll be in the green space near Allston Way, south of the creek.

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
