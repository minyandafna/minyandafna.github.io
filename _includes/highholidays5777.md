## High Holidays 2016/5777
{: .featurette-heading}

Minyan Dafna will be holding spirited and songful Yamim Noraim (High Holidays) services again this year in Berkeley. Join us for traditional-egalitarian davening, lead by community members.

**This year, we are delighted that [Rabbi Maya Resnikoff](/#rabbi-maya) will be joining us as our Rabbi in Residence for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.** 

Services are free, but a [donation](https://donorbox.org/minyan-dafna-high-holidays) of $18 per day or $36 for both Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur will help us defray the costs of space rental.
