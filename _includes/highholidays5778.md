{: .featurette-heading}

Minyan Dafna will be holding spirited and songful Yamim Noraim (High Holidays) services in Berkeley for its third year. Join us for traditional-egalitarian davening, lead by community members.

Services are free, but a [donation](https://donorbox.org/minyan-dafna-high-holidays-2017) of $18 per day or $36 for both Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur will help us defray the costs of space rental.
