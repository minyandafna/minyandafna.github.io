## BLACK LIVES MATTER
{: .featurette-heading}

Minyan Dafna mourns the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and the many others who have died at the hands of racism, white supremacy, and police violence. 
Our tradition teaches that "you shall not stand by while the blood of your neighbor is shed" (Vayikra 19:16). 
This admonition compels us to actively seek to eliminate racist violence and white supremacy, throughout our nation and our world. 
We stand in solidarity with those already engaged in that work. 
Within the Jewish community, we must hear and heed the voices of Black Jews and Jews of color&mdash;both [locally](https://www.jweekly.com/2020/06/11/for-jews-of-color-protests-are-reminders-of-pain-even-within-jewish-community/) 
and around the [country](https://www.jta.org/2020/05/31/united-states/believe-us-black-jews-respond-to-the-george-floyd-protests-in-their-own-words)&mdash;in order to ensure that Jewish spaces are truly inclusive and free of racism. 
We commit to educating ourselves individually, and as an organization, about how we can seek to dismantle white supremacy. 
May the memories of all those killed by systemic racism be for a blessing, and a revolution.
