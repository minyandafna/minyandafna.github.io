## High Holidays 2015/5776
{: .featurette-heading}

On Rosh Hashanah, the world was conceived, Sarah first conceived as an elderly woman, and we are given the opportunity to renew ourselves spiritually. This year, Minyan Dafna will hold its first High Holiday services, coming together on the mornings of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur to pray, sing, read, learn, and repent. All are welcome for traditional, egalitarian, and spirited davening.

Services are free, and we hope you will bring your friends and family!

After Rosh Hashana davening, we will have a communal kiddush in Berkeley Way Mini Park, around the corner from Finish Hall.

In the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashana, we will gather at 4:00 pm for Tashlich in Strawberry Creek Park.

### Location

We will be meeting on Rosh Hashana in the Upstairs Meeting Room at Finnish Hall. On Yom Kippur, we will be meeting **downstairs** at Finnish Hall.
