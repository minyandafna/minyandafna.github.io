## High Holidays 2019/5780
{: .featurette-heading}

Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafna's Rosh Hashanah celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian Maariv, led by community members, on both nights of Rosh Hashanah.
On the first night of Rosh Hashanah, services will be followed by a holiday dinner sponsored by Minyan Dafna.
On the second night of Rosh Hashanah, services will be followed by a festive potluck dinner.
Everyone is welcome for services and dinner on both nights!

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
