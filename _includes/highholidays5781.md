## High Holidays 2020/5781
{: .featurette-heading}

Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s High Holiday celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian davening, led by community members, on both days of Rosh Hashanah and for Neilah on Yom Kippur. We will also meet virtually for a Sing-O-Rama before Rosh Hashanah and for Tashlich and socially-distant schmoozing in the park on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
