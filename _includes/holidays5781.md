## High Holidays 2020/5781
{: .featurette-heading}

Connect with tradition and community at Minyan Dafnaâ€™s High Holiday celebrations.
Minyan Dafna will be gathering for a traditional-egalitarian davening, led by community members, on both days of Rosh Hashanah. We will also meet for Tashlich and socially-distant schmoozing in the park on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.

_Details about Yom Kippur will be available shortly._

The donations we receive around the High Holidays help support Minyan Dafna throughout the year. If you are able, a donation of any size is greatly appreciated.
